# Spatial Transcriptomics Tutorials
Introductory Tutorials For Spatial Transcriptomics Datasets

Here, we will be using a recently released dataset of sagital mouse brain slices generated using the Visium v1 chemistry. There are two serial anterior sections, and two (matched) serial posterior sections.

This repository contains the pre-processing and analysis steps for spatial transcriptomics data as well as integration of the spatial dataset with scRNA-seq data.

Please note this tutorial borrows heavily from Seuratâ€™s tutorials (https://satijalab.org/seurat/vignettes.html), so feel free to go through them in more detail.

The repository has spatial_transcriptomics.R (a R script for the analysis of spatial transcriptomics data and integration of the spatial data with scRNA-seq data).

The original data (stx_Brain) is freely avaialble from 10X Genomics website.

The Rscript has all the processes and steps defined with a "#", for the user's convenience.

All the image files (heatmaps, plots, and others) generated from the R script have been provided here.
